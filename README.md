AI-Based Thyroid Dysfunction Risk Prediction (Early Pregnancy)
Developed an AI-based diagnostic model to predict thyroid dysfunction risk during early pregnancy using machine learning techniques.
Implemented multi-class classification to identify different thyroid disorder categories.
Trained and validated Random Forest and Neural Network models, achieving 100% accuracy with Random Forest and 92% accuracy with Neural Networks.
Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robust predictions and minimal misclassification.
Designed frontend using HTML and CSS and built backend using Flask, enabling seamless data input and real-time result display.
Deployed a Chrome-compatible web application providing real-time thyroid disease risk prediction through a user-friendly interface.
